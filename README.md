- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Reno
- ğŸ‘€ I like to learn how things work and best way to do so is by creating them. 
- ğŸŒ± I currently study IT systems development.
- ğŸ“š This github profile contains mainly my school work but I'm hoping to upload some of my personal projects as well.
- ğŸ“« Feel free to explore my repositories or reach out to me on my email - repadj@taltech.com
